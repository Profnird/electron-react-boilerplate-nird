Simple electron-react boilerplate with webpack &amp; babel. Production ready so no need to stress.

I did a small husle after realizing Jerga99 repo on react-electron was just dev ready
It was a headache and a lot of worry on production and since his was simple I decided to work my butt around it
Successfully spending 1-night of my life to research into webpack and electron with react and finally with try & catcherr
$$Finally here enjoy ---- use for free to contribute and report issues
* Since I am not a master mind ---- I will be on the look out on Jerga99's repo for new changes on his side <br> I will also do well to come up with solutions 
I will do well to continueing maintaining this boilerplate*
